# TDM Calculator

Traffic Demand Management (TDM) calculator tool. DTLA Hack for LA is partnering with the Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT) to develop this tool to help planners at LADOT and real estate developers calculate how to meet some of Los Angelesâ€™s Mobility Plan 2035 goals.

Transportation Demand Management (TDM) is a defined set of strategies aimed at maximizing traveler choices while also improving mobility, reducing congestion, vehicle miles traveled, greenhouse gas emissions, and air pollution. For our project purposes, we are creating a TDM calculator tool to help real estate developers learn how to pass their development plans through the city with visible calculations based on their plans.

## Project Context

To start construction on a building in the City of Los Angeles, real estate developers must submit a proposal of their development plan to the city for review and must meet specific criteria for approval. Currently, the approval process generally follows these steps:

- Real estate developers submit development proposals.
- The city manually reviews the proposals against specific criteria.
- If a proposal meets the criteria, the city approves the plan.
- If it doesn't, the developer can request a meeting for further review and discussion. Otherwise, the plan is rejected.

Real estate developers currently lack visibility into the reasons why their development plans are rejected. The TDM Calculator aims to provide them with more transparency on how to get their development plans approved and, more importantly, incur fewer fines by following city building criteria.

The city will benefit from more efficient reviews of edge cases for building development plans while being able to approve compliant plans more easily.
