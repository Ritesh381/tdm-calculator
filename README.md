# TDM Calculator

Traffic Demand Management (TDM) Calculator Tool. DTLA Hack for LA is partnering with the Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT) to develop this tool to help planners at LADOT and real estate developers calculate how to meet some of Los Angelesâ€™s Mobility Plan 2035 goals.

Transportation demand management (TDM) is a set of strategies aimed at maximizing traveler choices while improving mobility, reducing congestion, vehicle miles traveled, greenhouse gas emissions, and air pollution. For our project, we are creating a TDM calculator tool to help real estate developers understand how to pass their development plans through the city, with visible calculations based on their plans.

## Project Context

To start construction on a building in the City of Los Angeles, real estate developers must submit a proposal of their development plan for city review and meet specific criteria to gain approval. Currently, the high-level process for approval is as follows:

- Real estate developers submit a development proposal.
- The city manually checks criteria through review.
- If the criteria are met, the city "approves" the plan.
- If not, the developer may request a meeting for further review and discussion. Otherwise, the plan is rejected.

Real estate developers currently lack insight into where their development plans might be rejected. The TDM Calculator aims to provide visibility into how to get their plans approved and, importantly, reduce fines by following city building criteria.

The city will benefit from having more time to review edge cases for development plans while being able to approve compliant plans with greater ease and less hassle.
